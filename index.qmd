In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used baby names from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:

- Understanding the different columns of the data set
- Finding the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:
    - females
    - males
- Plotting the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names
